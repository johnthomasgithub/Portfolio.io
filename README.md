  With GitHub Pages, once you push your changes from your Cloud9 workspace up to your GitHub repository, your page will be live on the Internet.

 To do so, you'll need to enter the following git commands into your bash terminal. Select the bash terminal in the Console View - the bottom window pane in Cloud9.

Enter the following commands, pressing ENTER after each one:

Note: for the first command, replace your-github-username with your own github username.

cd your-github-username.github.io

git add .

git commit -m 'add portfolio.html file'

git push

Give it a couple minutes and you should be able to view the additions to your website live on the web at username.github.io (Where username is your own GitHub username.)

You now have a portfolio on the Internet, whoot!
